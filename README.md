# File cleaning
Tool replacing tabulation(s) by four spaces and deleting useless end of line
spaces in a file. This can easily improve a Pylint dirty grade!

## Getting started
This tool runs with Python v3.6. To run it:
```
clean_file.py <file_name_1> <file_name_2> ... <file_name_n>
```
The user can choose to replace the original file with the cleaned one or not.

## Tests
The unit tests can be run with the following command:
```
py.test --doctest-module -v
```
